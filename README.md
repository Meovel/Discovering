# Discovering
Discovering is a web-based platform that allows organizations to share their content to public, let people explore new worlds and get connected to others with common interests.

Inspiration of the project is that nowadays in internet era, information explodes while valuable contents are often buried under massive irrelevant data. We are aiming at building a platform for people to efficiently get exposed to information that can be truly valuable for them and help information resources to spread their content which will be mutual beneficial.
